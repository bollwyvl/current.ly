==========
a userscript for an alternate view of the [89.3 The Current][current]'s 
[web streamer][stream].

I like this for running on a computer connected to a TV, or in a small window
on a second monitor.

__Fortcoming__


Features
========
- replace the default view with less clutter, leaving just:
  - artist
  - song title
  - full screen album art
  - light current branding
- zoom-and-enhances album art to 1200x1200
- launch search for song in
  - grooveshark (press `G` or `g`)
  - YouTube (press `Y` or `y`)


Installation
============
For the time being, click the [raw view][rawr] of the `.user.js` file. If you
have [Greasemonkey][gm] or [Tampermonkey][tm], you should be prompted to install
the user script.

If there are actually updates being made, we'll need to figure out something better.
